Using genetic programming to teach cars to drive a flash game.

This project uses the gaming_assembly.py file to genetically train cars to go around a given racing track. With enough training these cars should be able to navigate any new track given to them. The library pyparticles.py is used to keep all the code relating to the cars and the environment (and their interactions) separate.

Requires pygame, pickle, PIL(/Pillow), numpy.
